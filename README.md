## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Understand the concept and application of the **Chi-Square Test for Independence**
- Implement the test using real or simulated categorical data
- Interpret statistical output such as the chi-square statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom
- Make decisions based on the significance level

---

## 📚 Background

The **Chi-Square Test of Independence** evaluates whether two categorical variables are independent or associated. It is commonly applied in fields such as social science, market research, and medicine.

**Formula**:  
\[
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
\]  
Where:
- \( O \) is the observed frequency
- \( E \) is the expected frequency

## 📓 Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `matplotlib` (optional)

2. **Loading or Creating Categorical Data**
   - Creating a contingency table manually or from a dataset

3. **Applying the Chi-Square Test**
   - Using `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()`

4. **Interpreting Results**
   - Chi-Square Statistic
   - p-value
   - Degrees of Freedom
   - Expected frequencies

5. **Making Decisions**
   - Comparing the p-value with a significance level (commonly 0.05)

6. **(Optional) Visualization**
   - Bar plots or heatmaps to better understand categorical distributions

## 🧪 Dependencies

Install required libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib

git clone https://github.com/your-username/chi_square_analysis.git
cd chi_square_analysis
jupyter notebook chi_square_analysis.ipynb

## 📋 Applications

**Chi-square tests are used in:**

- **Survey data analysis** (e.g., gender vs. product preference)  
- **Medical studies** (e.g., treatment vs. recovery rate)  
- **Education research** (e.g., student grade level vs. club participation)
